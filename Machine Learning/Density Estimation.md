# Density Estimation with Gaussian Mixture Models
When we apply ML to data we often aim to represent data in some way. One simple approach is to take data points themselves as the representation of the data. However, this is not a very helpful approach if you  dataset is to ==big== or you want to represent ==characteristics== of your data. In density estimation, we represent data compactly using a density from a parametric family, e.g., a Gaussian or Beta distribution.
