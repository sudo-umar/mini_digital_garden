Three broad categories of charts:
- ## Trends : 
A trend is defined a pattern of change. 
 - ==sns.lineplot==-Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, multiple lines can be used to show trends  in more than one group.
- ## Relationships :

 - ==sns.barplot==. For comparing quinatities corresponding to different groups.
 - ==sns.heatmap==. Can be used to find color coded patterns in tables of numbers.
 - ==sns.regplot==. There is a regression line in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.
 - ==sns.lplot==. This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatterplot contains multiple, color-coded groups.
 - ==sns.swarmplot==. **Categorical scatterplots**
 It shows the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable. 
 - ## Distribution :
 - ==sns.distplot==. **Histograms** for a single numeric variable.
 - ==sns.kdeplot==. Shows distributions of a single numeric variable.
 - ==sns.joinplot==. This will create a 2D kde plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.
